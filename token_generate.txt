When trying to push code to github.com. I get the following error:

git push -u origin main
/usr/local/share/gcm-core/git-credential-manager-core get: 1: /usr/local/share/gcm-core/git-credential-manager-core: not found

fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/nadeembu/slot_machine_program.git/

To fix this problem. You need to generate a new token from the github website.
You will then use the token to authenticate instead of your github login password.

https://github.com/
Go into...
Settings
Developer settings
Personal access token
Generate new token

Note   : Enter anything
Expiry : 7-90days, no expiry or custom
Scopes : Define the level of access needed. 
Choose : repo and anything else you want.

Create token. 
Copy token
git push -u origin main
username : nadeembu
password : your_token
